C-BALLS - erotic tetris like game
=======

One of my first games remaining in the source code. I wrote it in 1996, working at a small company that is not afraid to hire me as a programmer.

## Gameplay

The game is a simplified version of Tetris, where the figures are always vertical lines of colorful balloons. Your task is to put them down, so that the lines of three balls of the same color in any direction are destroyed. Whenever this happens, the next part of the photo with a girl will appear on the screen.

When the picture will be completely open, you will proceed to the next level.

In addition to the balls in the game sometimes there are skeletons and bombs. I do not remember what exactly they do, but certainly something good and fun :)

Game has 15 levels. Each level has unique erotic picture to open. Every next level game speed is inreased.

Enjoy!
